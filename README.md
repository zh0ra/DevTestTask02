Developer test task 02
Again, the input is a long list of integers. Provide a working code that will find all the
pairs (in this integer list) that sum up to 13. Each pair in the output should have first
number not greater than the second one and lines should be sorted in an ascending
order.
Sample:
For the input:
1 2 10 7 5 3 6 6 13 0
expected output is:
0 13
3 10
6 7
6 7

Solution:
Use standard library of Arrays for sorting and adapting binary find pairs of sum up to 13.
